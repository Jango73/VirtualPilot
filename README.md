# VirtualPilot

This is a project I started using my 3D engine. I wanted to make a simple flight sim and model the Airbus A320.
It is a work in progress, there is much left to do.

## Things it does

* Load procedural terrain
* Load an A320 cockpit
* Simulate the electrical system
* Simulate part of the PFD, ND and SD displays
* Follow a basic flight plan (some test waypoints)
* Fly-by-wire
